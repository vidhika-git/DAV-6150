    "\n",
    "The HIV/AIDS epidemic has been one of the most problematic public health crises of the last century, impacting millions of lives globally. Within New York City, a metropolis with a significant at-risk population, the epidemic's dynamics are captured in detail through the DOHMH HIV/AIDS Annual Report. This dataset provides a granular view of the epidemic's progression, treatment outcomes, and demographic influences from year to year. The prevalence and management of HIV/AIDS remain critical issues, with significant implications for public health policy, resource allocation, and community outreach programs. Utilizing this dataset, we propose to construct a predictive model that can provide insights into the factors contributing to these outcomes and potentially forecast future trends.\n",
